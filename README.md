## DroidCam 2025

DroidCam turns your phone into a webcam! Use it with chat programs like Zoom, Discord, MS Teams, or with video production software like OBS Studio.

As a Windows application, this program works as a server which your cell phone will connect to, acting as the client. Therefore in order to use your phone's camera as a webcam on Windows, you're required to install the DroidCam app from the Google Play Store. It's free.

The concept is pretty simple and a good one at that. All you have to do is get the program running, configured and setup on your PC and run the Android client. DroidCam will connect either by WiFi, Ethernet or USB.
